# This script demonstrates the failover scenario where the primary provider Super Car fails to respond to a request.
# The system should be able to switch to the secondary provider and return a valuation.
# It will revert back to the primary provider after cool down period.
#
# To run this script, you need to do the following:
#  1. change the primary provider "SUPER_CAR_BASE_URL" URL in the .env.demo file to a non-existent URL
#  2. Run the application: npm run demo
#  3. Run this script: ./scripts/failover-demo.sh
